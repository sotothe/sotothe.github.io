#About
This is the repository for my website that I use to blog about my work and researches on AI, NLP, and HCI. I have some experience with WordPress and some other great CMSs, but I feel like Jekyll is a neat static website generator and good enough to use for a personal website.

Thanks to Dr. Alex Singleton letting me using his code for my website.
